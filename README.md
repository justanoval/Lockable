<img align="right" width="160" src="src/main/resources/assets/lockable/icon.png">
Lockable is a Minecraft mod for Quilt loader. It adds locks and keys to allow players to protect their items, or steal from others.

### Configuration
You can configure the mod by editing `lockable/config.json` in the config folder of your Minecraft directory or through
_ModMenu_.

## Who am I?
I am [justan oval](https://justanoval.com/). You may (or may not) know me from [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@justanoval), which has nothing to do with Minecraft.

I started developing for Minecraft around 2019-2020. I used to make plugins for events ran for content creators. I dabbled in mod development here and there, but only got into mod development in 2024.

If you want to see the other things I work on, check out [my website](https://justanoval.com/). I produce music, make animations, write stories, sell merchandise, and make games.
